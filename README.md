# heart-disease-prediction-xgboost

Short analysis of patients data concerning heart disease. Feature engineering using sklearn Pipeline. Hyperparameters tuning using Gridsearch.

I orginally created a simpler version of that notebook as an assignment at infoShare Academy during a Data Science course, thus some of the git history is missing.

Packages used:
pandas,
matplotlib.pyplot,
sklearn,
xgboost,
numpy

Created on Python version 3.11.5
